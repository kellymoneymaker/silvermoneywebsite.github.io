      <h1>Reviews</h1>
      <p>Wow! Killer Record! Heavy, dark, meaningful music.  If you like Tool, Evanescence, Perfect Circle, NIN, etc. you will love this!  This should have been the soundtrack to Watchmen.  There is great musicianship throughout.  The vocals are also stellar--from soulful belting to death screams.  Very glad I found this record.  --Save Music Now, iTunes Review<p>
      <p>I'll play this on my radio show!  FINALLY!  A female singer that kicks A*S and doesn't sound like a little girl.  Great lyrics and good musicianship.  Good mix of songs...nothing boring.  Good arrangements and mix.  I bought the whole CD which I hardly ever do.  --Michele Rundgren.</p>
      <p>This album rocks!  Edgy, dark and energetic.  Hard-hitting vocals.  Don't miss She's Breaking and Save Me.  --Susan Fromm, iTunes Reviews</p>
