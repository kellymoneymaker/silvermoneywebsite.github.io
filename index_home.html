      <h1>Silvermoney</h1>
      <p>Kelly Moneymaker and Dan Silver unite for hard-hitting collision, Silvermoney. Their debut album, Goddess Killer, was Written, Performed, Engineered and Produced by the duo. The underlying concept of the album embodies the problems with how humans have treated Mother Earth. The Green Goddess is given a voice to embody her strength and vulnerability while showcasing the talents of Silver and Moneymaker.  The release of Silvermoney's Goddess Killer spawned Ecohead Records, a label that embraces the idea of a greener, cleaner, more sustainable world by utilizing a solar-powered recording studio and eco-friendly manufacturing (soy-based inks, recycled plastic and cardboard packaging). New album scheduled for release in January 2018.</p>
